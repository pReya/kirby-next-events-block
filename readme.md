# kirby-next-events

This is custom block plugin for [Kirby CMS](getkirby.com/) that shows upcoming events according to a given external calendar (e.g. from Google or Nextcloud). The calendar source, amount of events, timespan of events and caching options can be configured in the actual block itself. So this can be used on multiple pages/locations of a Kirby website.
